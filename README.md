# YourSmallDB
A small DataBase fully written in JS. It's realized in JS objects. It has a plenty of default functions to work with.

# Files explained:
## 1.DB:
This class lets you create a small DataBase, it has default methods like removeItem(), clearRoot(), createKeyPoint() and so on.
## 2.DBsController:
This class lets you manipulate lots of different DataBases at the same time! It its own default methods like addDBs(), compareDBs(), hasDB() and more.

### Anything else to make it work?
const JavaScriptVanilla = true;
alert("This library(if you can call it so) doesn't require anymore things than just downloading and linking it to your html to work properly");

### Updates?
This is the first load, I guess I'll add more functions later...

#### let whenUpdate = undefined;
